ProjectionBasedDynamics
=======================
Repository is forked from: https://github.com/rarietta/Projective-Dynamics

Implementation for final year project:
* Includes partial implementation of CUDA local solver
* Tetrahedral meshes generated using Tetgen in filepath: fast_mass_spring/tet_rope_mesh 
* 1D/2D line in 3D space to act as the thread since volumetric mesh would cause performance issues.
